## 1. Overview
SecureVault is designed with strict data privacy principles at its core.  
All data handled by SecureVault is **encrypted locally** and remains entirely under the user’s control at all times.

SecureVault **does not** transmit, synchronize, collect, store, or share any personal data outside of the user’s own device.

---

## 2. Local-Only Data Processing
All operations take place locally:
- Files are stored in an encrypted container on the user’s system
- Decryption occurs only in memory during an active session
- No cloud connection is needed or utilized
- No telemetry, tracking, analytics, or background networking

**SecureVault never uploads any data** to remote servers.

- Personal identity information  
- Credentials or passwords

- Maintaining backups (if desired)

SecureVault cannot restore access if the user forgets their password.
